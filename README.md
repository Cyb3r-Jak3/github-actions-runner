# GitHub Actions Runner Image

This repository contains a Dockerfile for building a GitHub Actions runner image. The image is based on the official GitHub Actions runner and includes additional tools and configurations for running GitHub Actions workflows in a containerized environment.

This image is designed for my needs. Others are welcome to use it but may need to modify it to suit their own needs.
